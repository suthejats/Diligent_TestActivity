Write a prompt to generate a SQL query for SQLite that joins users, orders, order_items, products, and payments into a single view of successful orders.

Return:
- user name
- order_id
- order_date
- product_name
- quantity
- unit_price
- (quantity * unit_price) AS total_value
- payment_method
- amount

Only include rows where payment status = 'success'.
Sort the results by order_date descending.
Output only the SQL.
